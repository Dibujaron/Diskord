## [X.X.X] - XXXX-XX-XX

### Added
- Added support for gateway intents.

## [1.7.3] - 2020-08-09

### Added/Fixed
* Fixed an issue with `GuildClient.createBan` not sending the correct request

### Added/Fixed
Addressed an issue where the `GuildClient.updateMember` method did not allow disconnecting
a guild member from voice channels.

request but only disconnects members from voice.

Addressed an issue where ktor does not close the receiving channel of the websocket client when the connection closes

## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-04

### Breaking Change
Ktor has been updated to the 1.3.x release.  This update merges an external 
dependency, which resulted in a package name change.  If you are using the FileData 
object with a raw byte packet, then make sure to update the following packages: 

    import kotlinx.io. -> import io.ktor.utils.io.
    import kotlinx.coroutines.io. -> import io.ktor.utils.io.

*Note: Several classes and constants have been re-arranged in the* `com.jessecorbett.diskord.api.rest.client.internal` 
*package to help facilitate better testing. Any code depending on these changes will break. It is highly recommended 
not to depend on any code marked with the* `@DiskordInternals` *annotation in the future, as we provide no guarantee 
that this code will not be changed between releases, even between minor or patch releases.*

### Added
- Added @DiskordInternals annotation to mark internal APIs.
